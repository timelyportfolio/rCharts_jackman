### Make Simon Jackman Post Reproducible with rCharts

When I spotted Simon Jackman's post [ideal point graphics, via d3](http://jackman.stanford.edu/blog/?p=2888), I commented:

<blockquote>
Looks like a great potential use of rCharts, so you can streamline the workflow
<br/>
“My R scripts dump csv containing the ideal point estimates, credible intervals, labeling info, which I then pick up on the d3 side. ”
<br/>
would be happy to put a prototype together; will see if I can do it with what is already included
</blockquote>

This repo will serve as the prototype how in the style of [Ben Hunter](http://mostlyconjecture.com/blog/) and [TimelyPortfolio 512 Paths](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/04/d3-r-with-rcharts-and-slidify.html), we can employ `rCharts` to make our custom interactive charts flexible and reproducible.  This structure results in numerous benefits:

1 ?
2 ?
3 ?


Fork/clone the repo and see [code.R] for an simple quick example how this can be accomplished.
